    "\n",
    "The final layer of knowledge to master for any programming language: **Object Oriented Programming**. OOP not only introduces the concept of classes but also provides standards when it comes to develop softwares and libraries. In this course, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is OOP and how it is structured\n",
    "* Why doing OOP\n",
    "* Python classes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The OOP structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by talking about the structure and vocabulary related to OOP, as this will make it easier for you to understand why we do it and the fundamental principles on which OOP is based. Here's the general structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **An object**: Anything can designate an object: a class is an object, a function is an object etc. When we don't know the type of data we are dealing with, we will talk about an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **A class**: A class is a collection of methods, variables... that will allow to execute a certain number of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **An attribute**: These are the variables contained in a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **A method**: When we build functions, in a class, we are actually talking about methods. These functions have been used before, and are those that start with a dot (ex: _.pop()_)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **An instance**: An instance is a representant of a class, that is, each time you are going to use a class, you are going to create an instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "These five vocabulary words are the ones you need to keep in mind. You're not going to understand them all right away, that's perfectly normal. We'll build classes and it'll all come together quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole purpose of OOP is to create code that is more robust, flexible and more easily reusable. It is based on 4 principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation\n",
    "2. Abstract\n",
    "3. Heritage\n",
    "4. Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly explain each of these principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation**: In OOP, we have attributes nested in classes. This allows us to \"arrange\" the variables relative to the same object (for example, we will arrange in the same object the age and salary parts of a person). It is also very useful for hiding from the user variables that are useful for the operation of the code but whose values the user does not necessarily need to know or manipulate directly. This principle of having attributes nested in classes respects what is called encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person():\n",
    "    def __init__(self, salary, age):\n",
    "        self.salary = salary\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_salary(self):\n",
    "        return self.salary\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def get_age(self):\n",
    "        return self.age\n",
    "    \n",
    "person = Person(2700, 25)\n",
    "print(person.get_salary()) #output: 2700 \n",
    "print(person.get_age()) #output: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction**: Abstraction tells us that: \"If there is complex code that the user doesn't need, we might as well hide it\". The idea behind this is to prevent the user from bringing bugs into the programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.make_sound()  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "cat.make_sound()  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heritage**: There can be a hierarchy in classes and methods. You can have parent classes and child classes that inherit the attributes of the parent class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_color(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Color:\", self.color)\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, radius):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color)\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_area(self):\n",
    "        area = 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n",
    "        print(\"Area:\", area)\n",
    "\n",
    "circle = Circle(\"Red\", 5)\n",
    "circle.display_color()  # Output: Color: Red\n",
    "circle.display_area()  # Output: Area: 78.5\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is very much related to inheritance. It means that in addition to inheriting the attributes of the parent classes, each of the methods of the parent class can adapt to different possible situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def make_animal_sound(animal):\n",
    "    print(animal.make_sound())\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "make_animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "make_animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__() method is a special method: it is the one that will be called each time a class instance is created. It determines how the attributes will be initialized. As soon as your class contains internal attributes, you should think about defining the __init()__. Sometimes you may create a class that has no internal attributes. In this case, you don't need the __init()__.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "name_instance1.methode1(arguments_methode1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: each method defined in the class has a list of arguments that starts with a particular keyword, denoted `self`. In python, `self` represents the instance of the class and is always the first argument to a method. It is because we write `methode1(self,...)` that we can then call the method with a dot: `instance_name1.method1(...)`. If you forget the `self' argument when defining the method, you will get an error when trying to call the method."
